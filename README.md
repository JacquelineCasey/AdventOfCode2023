# AdventOfCode2023

This year I am using this to learn Go! Previous years I've used C++ and Zig, and I often code in Rust, so Go is a change of pace for sure. 

To run a given file, do `go run {file} < input.txt`. Note that the input files are not included here, because the creator of Advent of Code has requested they not be shared, so you will need to fetch your own inputs.
